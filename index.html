You'll learn how to work with other chefs in a hectic environment, you'll learn how to compromise, you'll learn how to handle a knife, the foundation of cooking, and countless other valuable techniques and practices. Beyond that, when you leave this class you'll have something to show for it. By enrolling and staying committed you'll become certified to handle food and work in any culinary setting. This class isn't cooking, it's culinary arts and by the end of it you'll understand the difference perfectly.</p>
